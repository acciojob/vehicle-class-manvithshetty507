# Vehicle Class

## Instructions

Create a class Vehicle with properties make, model, and year. Add a method start() that logs "Engine started" to the console. Create a subclass Car that extends Vehicle, and has an additional property color. Override the start() method of the Car class to also log "Radio turned on" to the console.

Sample input:

```let car = new Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2021, "Red");
console.log(car.color); // Red

car.start(); // Engine started \n Radio turned on
```
